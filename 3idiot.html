        <h4>3 Idiots follows three engineering students, Rancho, Farhan, and Raju, at the prestigious Imperial College
            of
            Engineering. Rancho challenges the strict, rote-learning system, clashing with the college director, Dr.
            Virus.
            After a classmate, Joy, commits suicide due to academic pressure, Rancho exposes the flaws in the system.
            Rancho
            helps Farhan pursue photography and supports Raju through family struggles. The trio prank Chatur, a
            competitive
            student, and make a bet with him about success. Raju attempts suicide but survives, leading to his recovery
            and
            eventual success. The trio is expelled after stealing an exam paper, but they’re later forgiven after saving
            Virus’s daughter during childbirth. Years later, they discover the real Rancho is Phunsukh Wangdu, a famous
            inventor. Rancho’s true identity inspires his friends to follow their dreams. <br> <br>
