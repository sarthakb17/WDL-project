        <h4>Naal (2018) tells the story of Chaitanya, an eight-year-old boy living with his father, mother, and
            grandmother in a remote Maharashtra village. He learns from his uncle that his mother is not his biological
            parent, leading him to believe his "real" mother is someone named Parvati. Chaitanya tests his mother's love
            by pretending to run away but is beaten when he returns, deepening his emotional distance from her. He
            causes his grandmother's injury in an attempt to delay a trip to meet Parvati, but the calf they own dies,
            further affecting the family. Chaitanya's grandmother dies during a trip to the city, and Chaitanya becomes
            upset, unaware of the situation. He later realizes that the mother who raised him is the one who truly cares
            for him. By the end, Chaitanya calls his mother "Aai" again, acknowledging her love and presence in his
            life. The film explores themes of love, identity, and family bonds.
