        <h4>Aniket, unhappily married to Avani, devises a sinister plan with his girlfriend Devika to fake a suicide
            pact and murder Avani, who suffers from a severe mental disorder and resists divorce. However, their scheme
            unravels when Avani's body and suicide note vanish after her death. Dr. Anshuman, Avani's psychiatrist and
            secret lover, reveals he killed her to protect his reputation after discovering she was pregnant with his
            child. As the trio attempts to dispose of the body, they inadvertently commit more murders, including
            killing a woman and a police inspector in chaotic circumstances. Planning to bury the bodies later, they
            store them at Aniket's house but meet a darkly ironic end when a falling chandelier crushes them all. The
            story concludes with termites gnawing on a nylon rope, symbolizing the ultimate poetic justice.
