        <h4>The film follows Ganpat Ramchandra Belwalkar (Appa), a veteran theatre actor who once achieved fame and
            fortune. After bequeathing all his wealth to his children, Appa's frankness and use of expletives strain his
            relationships, especially with his daughter-in-law and son. Appa and his wife Kaveri move in with their
            daughter Vidya, where Appa’s behavior continues to cause tension. After the death of his close friend
            Rambhau, Appa grants his friend’s last wish. The rift with Vidya deepens when she falsely accuses her
            parents of stealing money. Appa and Kaveri leave for their ancestral village, where Kaveri dies of fever.
            Appa, now destitute, finds solace in a poor boot polishwala named Raja. In the end, Appa's past catches up
            with him, and he dies after delivering his final performance on stage, leaving behind a legacy of both
            tragedy and greatness.
