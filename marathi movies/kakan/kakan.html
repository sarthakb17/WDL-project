        <h3>Information of the movie :</h3>
        <h4>A group of boys talk about an old, shabby man named Kishu, who lives near a deserted fort. A mischievous
            boy, Gopi, goes to tease him but sees the sadness in his eyes and leaves. One day, Gopi falls into a river
            while fishing and is saved by Kishu, leading to their friendship. Gopi learns that Kishu once loved Sudha,
            but her parents opposed their marriage due to his poverty. One day, Sudha lost her gold bangle in the lake,
            and Kishu promised to replace it. He sold his land to buy a new bangle, but in his absence, Sudha was
            married off to a rich man. Heartbroken, Kishu wandered the village like a beggar, unable to recover from his
            pain. When Kishu falls ill, Gopi searches for Sudha and convinces her to return. She meets Kishu and asks
            him to place the bangle on her hand. With this final act, Kishu takes his last breath in Sudhaâ€™s arms.</h4>
