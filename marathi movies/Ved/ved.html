        <h3>Information of the movie :</h3>
        <h4>Satya Jadhav, an aspiring cricketer from Bombay, dreams of joining the Indian team but struggles
            financially. He meets Nisha, and after initial misunderstandings, they fall in love, but her strict Naval
            officer father separates them. Heartbroken when Nisha never returns, Satya turns to alcohol, abandoning his
            cricket dreams. His childhood neighbor, Shravani, secretly loves him and later marries him out of concern,
            though he does not reciprocate. She supports him financially while he drowns in past memories. Years later,
            Satya meets Khushi, Nisha’s daughter, and learns Nisha died in an accident. Honoring Nisha’s wish, he trains
            Khushi in cricket and adopts her with Shravani. Khushi insists they mend their broken marriage before she
            accepts them. Realizing Shravani’s love, Satya finally lets go of his past. At the railway station, he
            confesses his love, and Shravani stays, completing Satya’s journey toward love.</h4>
